# Competitive Programming Journey

Welcome to my competitive programming repository!
This is where I document my progress, practice, and problem-solving journey as I work toward becoming a stronger competitive programmer.

You'll find:

- Codeforces solutions — written in C++

- LeetCode solutions — a mix of Python and C++

I’m continuously learning and improving, feel free to explore, suggest optimizations, or share your own approaches!
